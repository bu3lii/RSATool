# RSA Tool

This project is a lightweight Java-based implementation of a basic RSA encryption and decryption system using modular arithmetic and number theory.

### Features
- Pure Java — no `modPow()`, no libraries
- Implements:
  - GCD & Extended Euclidean Algorithm
  - Modular inverse
  - Modular exponentiation
  - Euler's totient function
  - Basic RSA-style encryption/decryption with ASCII letter mapping (`a`–`z`)
- CLI Menu with 3 modes:
  1. Encrypt message
  2. Decrypt message
  3. Find remainder

### This was built for a Discrete Mathematics course project
- Do not expect any further updates to this
- Not too useful in a real context as this requires knowing the two primes to begin decrypting the message (spoiler alert: thats the hard part)
